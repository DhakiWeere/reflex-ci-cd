# Reflex CI/CD
### Self Reacting System
**Reflex CI/CD** is a bidirectional CI/CD demonstration project designed to showcase full automation between a GitHub repository and an AWS EC2-hosted web app.  
It not only deploys automatically on each push — it also lets you edit and commit code *back* to the GitHub repo directly from the running web interface.

## 🚀 Features

- **Automatic Deployment via GitHub Actions**  
  Every new commit triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that connects to your EC2 instance, pulls the latest changes, and rebuilds the app.

- **Web-Based Code Editor**  
  The hosted app includes a live HTML editor that displays the current code from the GitHub repo.

- **Reverse Sync to GitHub**  
  Edits made in the web app can be committed back to the repository using the GitHub API, creating a continuous feedback loop.

- **Simple, Lightweight Stack**  
  Built using Node.js (Express) + a minimal frontend editor (Monaco or CodeMirror). Deployed on an EC2 instance using SSH.
